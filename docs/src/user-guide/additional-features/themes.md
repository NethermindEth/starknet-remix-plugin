# Themes

The Starknet Remix Plugin seamlessly integrates with Remix IDE's theming system, allowing you to customize your development environment's appearance for better readability and reduced eye strain.

## Theme Integration

The plugin automatically inherits and applies the theme you've selected in Remix IDE. This ensures a consistent visual experience across your entire development environment.
