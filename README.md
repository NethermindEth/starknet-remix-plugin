### Troubleshooting

Most issues with Starknet plugin or Remix itself are caused by connectivity problems (also resulting from restricted networks, web-proxies blocking certain content, etc.) or browser plugin interference. 
- A user should first attempt to disable any browser components & addons which may impact the connectivity or Javascript execution. 
- Some networks may restrict connectivity to certain sites or domains. Using a VPN connection may resolve problems observed on restricted networks.

More specific potential error causes are also described in detail below. 

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Problems when searching plugins in Remix UI</strong></summary>  
<br/>
Searching for online plugins in Remix IDE may return blank or otherwise incorrect content, such as on screenshot below:

![Plugin search not working](docs/images/plugin-search-error.png)
Ensure that the following URL is accessible from a web browser, and that a JSON metadata code is returned -  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-plugins-directory/master/build/metadata.json :

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Problems when launching Starknet plugin in Remix UI</strong></summary> 
<br/>  
Starknet plugin launch issues may be caused by connectivity errors or plugin components being unavailable. This can be tested from web browser, as indicated below:

- https://cairo-remix.nethermind.io should respond with blank page (advanced: viewing page source will reveal a React component entry HTML markup) - no errors should be reported by the browser
- https://cairo-remix-api.nethermind.io/health should respond with `OK`
- https://starknet-remix-devnet.nethermind.io/predeployed_accounts should respond with JSON text describing predeployed Starknet accounts
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. `localStorage` access errors</strong></summary>  
<br/>
The following error indicates that the browser is blocking access to `localStorage` element of the webpage:

![localStorage access error](docs/images/plugin-localStorage-error.png)
Possible causes:
  
   - Chrome is launched in incognito mode
   - Chrome setting "Block third-party cookies" is activated (see [chrome://settings/cookies](chrome://settings/cookies)):
![Chrome cookies settings](docs/images/plugin-chrome-cookies-settings.png)
Note: even with "Block third-party cookies" activate, exceptions can be added to a whitelist - the whitelist must include:
     - https://remix.ethereum.org
     - https://cairo-remix-test.nethermind.io
   - ...also see this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30481516/iframe-in-chrome-error-failed-to-read-localstorage-from-window-access-deni) for potential hints.

## For Developers

### Installation

#### API

Our API is built with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/), a web framework for Rust. So, you'll need to get Rust and Cargo on your machine to get started. üõ†Ô∏è

The easiest way to install Rust and Cargo is by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). It's the [recommended tool](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for managing Rust versions and associated tools for your project.

Then:

```bash
cd api;
git submodule update --init;
cargo build;
```

#### Plugin

The plugin it self is a React project, you'll need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm).

```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm install;
```

#### Running the development environment

You need to be running both the server and the plugin in order to have a working environment.

For your dev environment:
```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm run start;
```

For an optimized build (will not listen to changes):
```
pnpm run deploy;
pnpm run serve;
```

```bash
cd api;
cargo run;
```

or alternatively, you can run the server in watch mode (with `cargo watch`):

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch;
cargo watch -x run;
```

For devnet interactions, you'll need to use [Starknet Devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/Starknet-devnet).

##### Connecting the plugin

In [Remix](http://remix-alpha.ethereum.org/), go to the `Plugin Manager` at the bottom of the left panel, and click on `Connect to a Local Plugin`.

Then, chose a name for the plugin, and in the `URL` field, enter `http://localhost:3000`, the `Type of Connection` should `iframe` and the `Location in remix` `Side Panel` and click on `Ok`, see the image below.

![Plugin Manager](./docs/images/plugin-import.png)

You should be all set to see the magic happen! Activate the plugin and it should now be visible and ready to be hacked with! üöÄ
