## For Developers

### Installation

#### API

Our API is built with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/), a web framework for Rust. So, you'll need to get Rust and Cargo on your machine to get started. üõ†Ô∏è

The easiest way to install Rust and Cargo is by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). It's the [recommended tool](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for managing Rust versions and associated tools for your project.

Then:

```bash
cd api;
git submodule update --init;
cargo build;
```

#### Plugin

The plugin it self is a React project, you'll need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm).

```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm install;
```

#### Running the development environment

You need to be running both the server and the plugin in order to have a working environment.

For your dev environment:
```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm run start;
```

For an optimized build (will not listen to changes):
```
pnpm run deploy;
pnpm run serve;
```

```bash
cd api;
cargo run;
```

or alternatively, you can run the server in watch mode (with `cargo watch`):

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch;
cargo watch -x run;
```

For devnet interactions, you'll need to use [Starknet Devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet).

##### Connecting the plugin

In [Remix](http://remix-alpha.ethereum.org/), go to the `Plugin Manager` at the bottom of the left panel, and click on `Connect to a Local Plugin`.

Then, chose a name for the plugin, and in the `URL` field, enter `http://localhost:3000`, the `Type of Connection` should `iframe` and the `Location in remix` `Side Panel` and click on `Ok`, see the image below.

You should be all set to see the magic happen! Activate the plugin and it should now be visible and ready to be hacked with! üöÄ
